These scripts create a PostgreSQL build environment for Windows, and build
PostgreSQL.

They're for NMake, the Microsoft version of make that uses cmd.exe. It comes
with Visual Studio. Yes, that's horrid, but it's better than trying to disentangle
the environment of mingw from that of Visual Studio.

You will require installs of ActiveState Perl, ActiveState TCL, Python.org
Python 2, MinGW, git (from git-scm.org), and the Microsoft SDK 7.1 to use these
scripts. Instructions on unattended installs for these tools are coming shortly;
just need to copy them from another machine.

Edit:

    pg_build_win\settings.mak

Build with:

    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\bin\nmake.exe" /f pg_build_win\Makefile postgresql
